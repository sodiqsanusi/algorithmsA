# An archive for algorithms I've worked on

In each folder is a README file explaining the task to be solved and the code I used in solving the said task.
>**Disclaimer!** I'm still working on my data structure and algorithms knowledge, so pardon me if my code isn't as optimal as you may expect, "t" for thanks🤞🏾.

**Edit:** It has been getting tough to share most of the algorithms I've worked on or solved. So I'll have to stop pushing code to this repo. <br>
If you want to check out my algorithm skills tho, you can check out my [CodeWars account](https://www.codewars.com/users/sodiqsanusi), most of the algorithms I solve are from there by the way.
