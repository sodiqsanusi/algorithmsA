# An archive for algorithms I've worked on

In each folder is a README file explaining the task to be solved and the code I used in solving the said task.
>**Disclaimer!** I'm still working on my data structure and algorithms knowledge, so pardon me if my code isn't as optimal as you may expect, "t" for thanks🤞🏾.
